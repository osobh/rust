# Product Context: Why rustg Exists

## The Problem Space

### Current Rust Compilation Bottlenecks

Rust's compile times have long been a source of developer frustration. While Rust provides unmatched safety and performance guarantees, the compilation process itself has significant limitations:

**Sequential Processing**: Traditional compilers like rustc are fundamentally sequential, utilizing only a single CPU core for most compilation phases. Even with parallel codegen units, the majority of compilation work remains single-threaded.

**Memory Bandwidth Limitations**: Modern CPUs are often memory-bound during compilation, waiting for data transfers rather than utilizing computational capacity. This creates artificial performance ceilings.

**Increasing Codebase Complexity**: As Rust projects grow larger and embrace more sophisticated type systems, trait hierarchies, and macro usage, compilation times scale poorly. Large projects can take 10+ minutes to compile.

**Development Workflow Impact**: Slow compilation creates a feedback loop that reduces developer productivity. The "compile, test, debug" cycle becomes a significant bottleneck in iterative development.

### Current Solutions Fall Short

Existing approaches to improve Rust compilation speed have fundamental limitations:

- **Incremental Compilation**: Helps with repeated builds but doesn't address cold compilation times
- **Parallelization Efforts**: Limited by Amdahl's law due to inherent sequential dependencies
- **Caching Solutions**: Reduce redundant work but don't fundamentally change compilation architecture
- **Hardware Upgrades**: Provide linear improvements but don't leverage available parallel processing power

## The GPU Opportunity

### Massive Parallel Processing Power

Modern GPUs provide thousands of processing cores compared to 8-64 CPU cores. This represents a 100x+ increase in potential parallelism for workloads that can be adapted:

- **NVIDIA H100**: 16,896 CUDA cores
- **AMD MI300X**: 19,456 stream processors  
- **Apple M3 Max**: 4,096 GPU cores

### Memory Bandwidth Advantages

GPUs offer significantly higher memory bandwidth than CPUs:

- **CPU (DDR5-5600)**: ~45 GB/s
- **GPU (HBM3)**: ~3,000+ GB/s

This 60x bandwidth advantage directly addresses compilation bottlenecks.

### Specialized Parallel Algorithms

Many compilation tasks can be reconceptualized for parallel execution:
- Token parsing can be done in parallel across file regions
- Type checking can leverage constraint solving algorithms
- Optimization passes can run simultaneously on different functions
- Code generation can parallelize instruction selection
