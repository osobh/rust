# rustg + StratoSwarm Integration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive integration strategy between **rustg** (GPU-native Rust compiler) and **StratoSwarm** (distributed agent orchestration platform). Rather than implementing rustg Phase 8 (Distributed OS) from scratch, we propose leveraging StratoSwarm's existing 100% complete distributed infrastructure while using rustg to compile StratoSwarm's GPU-intensive components for massive performance gains.

### Strategic Rationale

- **rustg Status**: Phases 1-7 complete, providing world-class GPU-native Rust compilation
- **StratoSwarm Status**: 100% complete with 29 production-ready crates implementing all Phase 8 features
- **Integration Opportunity**: 5-10x performance improvement for GPU-accelerated distributed consensus
- **Time to Market**: Immediate deployment vs. 6-12 months to build Phase 8 from scratch

### Expected Performance Gains

| Component | Current Performance | With rustg | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Consensus Latency | 73.89μs | <30μs | **3x faster** |
| Knowledge Queries | 19.4M/sec | 60M+/sec | **3x faster** |
| GPU Utilization | 73.7% | 95%+ | **29% improvement** |
| Evolution Algorithms | CPU-bound | GPU-parallel | **100-1000x faster** |
