# Project Brief: rustg - GPU-Native Rust Compiler

## Overview

The rustg project is an ambitious undertaking to create the world's first fully GPU-native compiler for the Rust programming language. Unlike traditional compilers that run on the CPU, rustg performs the entire compilation pipeline—from parsing to machine code generation—directly on the GPU using parallel processing techniques.

## Core Vision

Create a revolutionary Rust compiler that achieves >10x performance improvements over rustc by leveraging massive parallelism available in modern GPUs. The compiler will be entirely self-contained on the GPU, requiring minimal CPU intervention.

## Key Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Complete GPU Implementation**: All compilation phases (parsing, macro expansion, type checking, optimization, code generation) execute on GPU
- **Massive Parallelism**: Leverage thousands of GPU cores for simultaneous processing
- **Performance Target**: 10x speedup over traditional rustc compiler
- **Zero CPU Dependency**: Autonomous GPU-resident compilation pipeline
- **Full Rust Support**: Handle 95%+ of existing Rust codebases

### Technical Targets
- Process 1M+ lines of code per second
- Compile entire crate graphs in parallel
- Generate native GPU code (SPIR-V, PTX, Metal)
- Maintain full Rust language compatibility
- Support real-time compilation for development workflows

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Lexical analysis and parsing on GPU
- Macro expansion system with hygiene
- Type inference and trait resolution
- MIR generation and optimization passes  
- LLVM-free code generation
- Memory management and job orchestration
- Error handling and diagnostics

### Out of Scope (Initially)
- Procedural macros (requires host fallback)
- Complex const evaluation
- Full Non-Lexical Lifetimes implementation
- Incremental compilation (future enhancement)

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- **Throughput**: >1M LOC/second compilation speed
- **Latency**: <100ms for 10K LOC codebase
- **Memory**: <10GB GPU memory for large projects
- **Accuracy**: 99.9% compatibility with rustc output

### Functional Requirements
- Successfully compile rust standard library
- Handle complex trait hierarchies and generics  
- Generate valid SPIR-V/PTX/Metal output
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Support all Rust editions (2015, 2018, 2021)

## Implementation Strategy

The project is structured in 7 sequential phases:

1. **Phase 1**: GPU-based parsing and tokenization
2. **Phase 2**: Parallel macro expansion
3. **Phase 3**: Crate graph resolution
4. **Phase 4**: MIR generation and optimization
5. **Phase 5**: Type resolution and borrow checking
6. **Phase 6**: Code generation (SPIR-V/PTX)
7. **Phase 7**: Job orchestration and memory management

Each phase builds upon the previous ones, with clear success criteria and deliverables.
