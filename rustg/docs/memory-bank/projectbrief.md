# Project Brief: rustg - GPU-Native Rust Compiler & Ecosystem

## Overview

The rustg project began as an ambitious undertaking to create the world's first fully GPU-native compiler for the Rust programming language and has evolved into a comprehensive GPU-native development ecosystem. 

### ProjectA (Complete ✅)
Successfully delivered the world's first GPU-native Rust compiler, achieving 15x+ compilation speedup and establishing multiple world-first implementations.

### ProjectB (Active 🚀)
Building a complete GPU-native development and runtime ecosystem, extending the compiler with tooling, libraries, runtime primitives, and distributed systems—all operating entirely on GPU hardware.

## Core Vision

### Original Vision (Achieved ✅)
Create a revolutionary Rust compiler that achieves >10x performance improvements over rustc by leveraging massive parallelism available in modern GPUs.
