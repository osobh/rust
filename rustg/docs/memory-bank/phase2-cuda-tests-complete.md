## Next Steps

With all CUDA tests written following strict TDD, the next phase is to:

1. **Implement Rust Modules** (Following the test specifications):
   - `src/allocator.rs` - Slab, region, and arena allocators
   - `src/scheduler.rs` - Work queues and task management
   - `src/communication.rs` - MPMC channels and atomics
   - `src/error_handling.rs` - Panic and logging infrastructure

2. **CUDA Bindings**:
   - Create FFI bindings for CUDA kernels
   - Implement host-device memory management
   - Setup kernel launch configurations

3. **Integration**:
   - Connect with rustg compiler
   - Integrate with Phase 1 components
   - Validate 10x performance improvement
