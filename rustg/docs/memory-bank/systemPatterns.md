# System Patterns: GPU Architecture and Technical Decisions

## Core Architectural Patterns

### Massively Parallel Processing Model

The rustg compiler is built around the fundamental principle of converting traditionally sequential compilation tasks into massively parallel operations. This requires systematic application of specific architectural patterns:

**SIMD-Style Processing**: Transform single-threaded operations into thousands of parallel operations
- Pattern: Each thread processes a small portion of the input
- Application: Lexical analysis with per-thread character spans
- Benefit: Linear scalability with GPU core count

**Warp-Level Cooperation**: Leverage GPU warp (32 threads) as fundamental cooperation unit  
- Pattern: Leader thread coordinates, worker threads execute
- Application: Parser state management and AST construction
- Benefit: Efficient intra-warp communication via shuffle operations

**Hierarchical Parallelism**: Organize work at multiple levels (thread, warp, block, grid)
- Pattern: Different granularities for different compilation phases
- Application: Block-level functions, warp-level expressions, thread-level tokens
- Benefit: Optimal resource utilization at each parallelism level

### Memory Architecture Patterns

**Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) Layout**: Optimize for coalesced memory access
```
// Instead of Array-of-Structures (AoS):
struct Token { type, start, length, metadata };
Token tokens[];

// Use Structure-of-Arrays (SoA):
struct TokenBuffer {
    u32 types[];
    u32 starts[]; 
    u16 lengths[];
    u64 metadata[];
};
```
- Rationale: Enables coalesced access when threads process same fields
- Impact: 10-50x memory bandwidth improvement over AoS

**GPU Memory Hierarchy Utilization**: Strategic placement of data in memory types
- **Constant Memory**: Lookup tables, grammar rules (64KB, cached)
- **Shared Memory**: Intermediate results, warp cooperation (48KB per block)
- **Global Memory**: Main data structures, AST storage (device memory)
- **Texture Memory**: Read-only reference data with spatial locality

**Memory Pool Management**: Efficient allocation without malloc/free overhead
```
struct MemoryPool {
    void* base_address;
    u32 block_size;        // Power-of-2 sized blocks
    u32* free_bitmap;      // Track allocation status
    u32 num_blocks;
};
```
- Pattern: Pre-allocated pools with atomic bitmap allocation
- Benefit: Eliminates memory allocation overhead during compilation

### Parallel Algorithm Patterns

**Fork-Join Parallelism**: Divide work, process in parallel, merge results
- Application: Parse multiple files simultaneously  
- Pattern: Spawn parallel tasks, synchronize on completion
- Implementation: CUDA dynamic parallelism with kernel launches

**Producer-Consumer Pipelines**: Stage compilation phases for overlapped execution
- Pattern: Phase N produces input for Phase N+1
- Application: Lexer → Parser → Type Checker pipeline
- Benefit: Hide latency through pipelining

**Reduction Operations**: Aggregate results from many threads
- Application: Error collection, statistics gathering, constraint solving
- Pattern: Tree-based reduction with warp-level primitives
- Implementation: `__shfl_down_sync()` for efficient reduction

**Parallel Prefix Scans**: Compute cumulative operations efficiently
- Application: Token offset calculation, memory allocation
- Pattern: Up-sweep/down-sweep phases for O(log n) scan
- Benefit: Replace sequential loops with parallel scans

### Data Structure Patterns

**Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Format**: Efficient graph representation
```
struct Graph {
    u32* row_offsets;    // Start of each node's edges
    u32* column_indices; // Target nodes  
    u32* edge_values;    // Edge weights/data
};
```
- Application: Dependency graphs, module hierarchies
- Benefit: Memory-efficient with coalesced access patterns

**Immutable Data Structures**: Avoid race conditions in parallel access
- Pattern: Copy-on-write semantics for modifications
- Application: AST nodes, type information
- Benefit: Safe concurrent read access without locking

**Flat Tree Representation**: Store trees as arrays for GPU efficiency
```
struct ASTNode {
    u32 node_type;
    u32 parent_index;
    u32 first_child;
    u16 child_count;
};
```
- Pattern: Convert hierarchical structures to flat arrays
- Benefit: Enables coalesced access and parallel traversal

### Synchronization Patterns

**Lock-Free Data Structures**: Avoid contention through atomic operations
- Pattern: Compare-and-swap (CAS) operations for updates
- Application: Token buffer writes, error reporting
- Benefit: Eliminates serialization bottlenecks

**Warp-Synchronous Programming**: Leverage implicit warp synchronization
- Pattern: All threads in warp execute same instruction
- Application: Parallel parsing with shared state
- Benefit: Avoids explicit synchronization overhead

**Atomic Aggregation**: Collect results without locks
```cuda
__device__ void append_token(TokenBuffer* buf, Token token) {
    u32 index = atomicAdd(&buf->count, 1);
    buf->types[index] = token.type;
    buf->starts[index] = token.start;
    // ...
}
```
- Pattern: Atomic increment for index allocation
- Benefit: Thread-safe without traditional locking

## Compilation-Specific Patterns

### Parser Architecture Patterns

**Parallel Descent Parsing**: Adapt recursive descent for parallel execution
- Pattern: Each warp handles one grammar rule
- Challenge: Handle recursive rules without stack overflow
- Solution: Iterative deepening with work queues

**Precedence Climbing**: GPU-adapted operator precedence parsing
- Pattern: Warp leader manages precedence stack
- Implementation: Shared memory for stack, threads handle operands
- Benefit: Natural fit for expression parsing parallelism

**Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of parse errors in parallel context
- Pattern: Continue parsing with error markers
- Implementation: Per-thread error state, reduction for collection
- Goal: Preserve partial AST for IDE integration

### Type System Patterns

**Constraint-Based Type Inference**: Parallel constraint solving
- Pattern: Generate constraints in parallel, solve iteratively
- Implementation: GPU-accelerated SAT solver techniques
- Benefit: Naturally parallel constraint propagation

**Union-Find for Type Unification**: Parallel unification with path compression
```cuda
__device__ u32 find_root(TypeVar* vars, u32 var) {
    while (vars[var].parent != var) {
        // Path compression
        u32 grandparent = vars[vars[var].parent].parent;
        vars[var].parent = grandparent;
        var = grandparent;
    }
    return var;
}
```
- Pattern: Atomic compare-and-swap for union operations
- Benefit: Efficient parallel type unification

### Memory Management Patterns

**Garbage Collection**: Parallel mark-and-sweep collection
- Mark Phase: Parallel marking from roots
- Sweep Phase: Parallel identification of unreachable objects  
- Compact Phase: Parallel memory compaction
- Pattern: Multiple GPU kernels with synchronization points

**Reference Counting**: Atomic reference counting for memory management
- Pattern: Atomic increment/decrement on reference operations
- Challenge: Cycle detection in parallel environment
- Solution: Periodic cycle detection with graph algorithms

### Error Handling Patterns

**Accumulate-and-Continue**: Collect errors without stopping compilation
- Pattern: Thread-local error buffers with final aggregation
- Benefit: Compile as much as possible for IDE support
- Implementation: Atomic append to global error buffer

**Structured Error Recovery**: Hierarchical error handling
- Pattern: Different recovery strategies at different compilation levels
- Example: Token errors vs parse errors vs type errors
- Benefit: Appropriate error handling granularity

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Memory Access Optimization

**Coalesced Access Patterns**: Ensure adjacent threads access adjacent memory
```cuda
// Good: Coalesced access
for (int i = threadIdx.x; i < n; i += blockDim.x) {
    process(data[i]);
}

// Bad: Strided access  
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % blockDim.x == threadIdx.x) {
        process(data[i]);
    }
}
```

**Shared Memory Banking**: Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access
- Pattern: Pad arrays to avoid power-of-2 strides
- Application: Frequently accessed lookup tables
- Benefit: Full shared memory bandwidth utilization

**Memory Prefetching**: Anticipate future memory needs
- Pattern: Load next data while processing current
- Implementation: Texture memory with hardware prefetch
- Benefit: Hide memory latency behind computation

### Computational Optimization

**Kernel Fusion**: Combine multiple passes into single kernels
- Pattern: Reduce memory bandwidth by eliminating intermediate storage
- Application: Parse and validate in single kernel
- Trade-off: Increased register pressure vs reduced memory traffic

**Occupancy Optimization**: Balance threads vs registers per SM
- Pattern: Configure launch parameters for maximum occupancy
- Tool: CUDA Occupancy Calculator for optimization
- Goal: Keep all SMs busy with sufficient parallelism

**Warp Divergence Minimization**: Reduce branching within warps
- Pattern: Sort work by execution path before processing
- Application: Group similar parsing tasks within warps
- Benefit: Maintain SIMD efficiency in SIMT execution

## Quality and Reliability Patterns

### Testing Patterns

**Parallel Testing Framework**: Test parallel algorithms correctly
- Pattern: Deterministic parallel execution for repeatability
- Challenge: Non-deterministic atomic ordering
- Solution: Multiple runs with result validation

**Property-Based Testing**: Test algorithmic properties rather than specific outputs
- Pattern: Generate random inputs, verify invariants
- Application: Parser correctness, type system soundness
- Benefit: Catch edge cases in parallel algorithms

### Debugging Patterns

**GPU Printf Debugging**: Debug parallel execution safely
- Pattern: Conditional printing with thread/warp identification
- Implementation: Thread-specific debug buffers
- Limitation: High overhead, use sparingly

**Host-Side Validation**: Verify GPU results on CPU
- Pattern: Implement reference implementation on CPU
