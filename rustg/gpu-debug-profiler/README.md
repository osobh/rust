# GPU Debug Profiler

A comprehensive GPU debugging and profiling infrastructure following strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. This project implements Phase 1, Component 3 of the GPU Rust Compiler infrastructure.

## Overview

The GPU Debug Profiler provides advanced debugging and performance analysis capabilities for GPU kernels, including:

- **Source Mapping**: Bidirectional mapping between source code and GPU IR
- **Timeline Tracing**: Nanosecond-precision kernel execution tracking
- **Performance Profiling**: Detailed performance analysis with flamegraph generation
- **Warp-Level Debugging**: Advanced breakpoint and step-through debugging

## Architecture

This project follows strict TDD principles with comprehensive CUDA test suites written FIRST before any implementation:

### Test Structure

All tests are located in `/tests/cuda/` and use real GPU operations without stubs or mocks:

1. **`source_mapping_test.cu`** - Tests bidirectional source/GPU IR mapping
2. **`timeline_tracing_test.cu`** - Tests nanosecond kernel execution tracking  
3. **`profiling_test.cu`** - Tests performance analysis and flamegraph generation
4. **`warp_debug_test.cu`** - Tests warp-level debugging and breakpoints

### Performance Targets

- **<5% Profiling Overhead**: All debugging infrastructure maintains minimal performance impact
- **Real-time Tracing**: Nanosecond precision timeline tracking
- **Sub-850 Line Files**: All source files kept under 850 lines for maintainability

## Implementation Philosophy

This project strictly follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

1. **Tests Written FIRST** - All CUDA test files were implemented before any infrastructure code
2. **Real GPU Operations** - No mocks or stubs; all tests use actual GPU computations
3. **Performance Focused** - <5% overhead requirement for all debugging features
4. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Every debugging feature has corresponding test validation

## Performance Validation

All tests include rigorous performance validation:

- **Overhead Measurement**: Baseline vs. instrumented execution comparison
- **Real-time Capability**: Sub-100ms iteration times for live debugging
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal memory overhead for debug data collection
- **Scalability**: Performance maintained across different problem sizes

## Future Implementation

The comprehensive test suite serves as the specification for implementing the actual debugging infrastructure. The tests validate:

- API contracts and data structures
- Performance requirements and constraints
- Feature completeness and edge cases  
- Integration scenarios and error handling

This TDD approach ensures that when the actual implementation is developed, it will meet all specified requirements and performance targets as validated by the existing test suite.
